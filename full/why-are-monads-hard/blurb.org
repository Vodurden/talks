It's time to ask the really hard questions: *Why are Monads so hard?*

No topic has inspired so much *confusion*, *fear* and *anger* as the humble Monad. Indeed, upon learning of the truth
they are known to warp the mind of the beholder, preventing their secrets from spreading further!

But why! Why are they so hard? Functor and Applicative don't inspire so much panic, so why Monad?

I have a theory: Monads are difficult to learn because the word "Monad" can refer to a huge
number of different concepts and ways of thinking.

So instead of trying to explain what a Monad is, I'm going to talk about all the things someone _could_
be talking about when they say "Monad".

This is the part of the synopsis where I lower your expectations:

- This talk will *not* teach you how to use Monads. But it _might_ give you a tiny bit more insight, no promises!
- This talk will use a mixture of languages and syntax but most of the examples probably won't compile

This talk is aimed at *Beginners*, *Advanced FP Folk* and anyone who's wondering *What's the hype with this Monad thing?*
