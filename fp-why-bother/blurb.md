*Today, 4pm GF Festival Hall*: Functional Programming - Why bother?

This is the *newly revamped version 2.0 of this talk*. It has _slides_ which I *never* do, so you know it's going
to be good.

Anyone who has touched a functional programming tutorial would agree: Learning functional programming is _hard_.

So why do we bother? Why do functional programmers spend so much time understanding monads, why do we fight for
strange languages and weird techniques? What is it that drives us and is there really anything valuable here?

This talk is specifically aimed at *beginners*. If you're curious about functional programming, if you don't know where
to start, if you've tried to learn functional programming before and found it confusing, difficult or demotivating then
*this talk is for you*.

Now for some expectation setting: This talk is *not* going to cover anything in depth. I'm not going to explain monads
or functors. I'm not going to talk about the elgence of type classes. I'm not going to write valid syntax for most
of the examples. I'm not even going to try and convince you that functional programming is a better paradigm.

Instead I'll show you what the world looks like from a functional programmer's eyes. At the end of the talk you won't
have learned any new techniques but you will understand the motivation behind the tools we use.

If that sounds interesting come join me for a fun and informal chat this Wednesday at the Functional Guild
