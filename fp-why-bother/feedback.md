# 2017-??-??

- I didn't record the feedback I got for this session! :( :(
- I think I told an anecdote about why I started with FP which resonated pretty well. Maybe incorporate into the notes?

- Intro is easy to follow (particularly learning vs. real-world)
- "How do you do anything" section is tricky to understand. Probably should be cut from a beginner talk
- Explicit distinction between static/dynamic typing would be good. Give examples of each? (Static exemplar: Haskell, Dynamic exemplar: Clojure?)
- Liked explicitly calling out that FP isn't better then OO, it's just a different way to solve a problem
- Consider carefully selecting the sequence of points could help with the overall flow of the talk
- Audience participation was really good. Particularly waiting for people to ask questions
- The key message "why bother" was still a bit unclear. Maybe a new section?
- Consider pointers on getting started on FP? Maybe more emphasis on the "where to start" section
- Consider talking about FP success stories? (Not sure if this one is on-topic for the talk, not trying to sell FP in this talk)
- Cautionary tale about "not trying to learn everything all at once" was good
- Buzzwords are a solution to a problem, not a goal to achieve
