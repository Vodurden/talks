# Why bother with anything

*We do things for a reason*

Programming: Solve problems, have fun

Paradigms: Change your thinking... to solve problems more easily:

- Imperative: Solve problems more easily (with imperative statements)
- Object Oriented: Solve problem more easily (with objects)
- Functional: Solve problems more easily (with functions)

Algorithms: Solve problems more easily. Solve problems you couldn't solve before.

Design patterns: Solve problems more easily?

What's common?

- Solve problems more easily
- Solve new problems
- Have fun
