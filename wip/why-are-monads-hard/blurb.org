It's time to ask the really hard questions: *What's a Monad?*

No topic has inspired so much *confusion*, *fear* and *anger* as the humble Monad. Indeed, upon learning of the truth
they are known to warp the mind of the beholder, preventing their secrets from spreading further!

So, how can I even give this talk? We're going to have to cheat!

I have a theory: Monads are especially difficult to learn because the word "Monad" can refer to a huge number of
different concepts and ways of thinking.

So instead of teaching precisely what a Monad is, we're going to explore a bunch of different ways to think about
the concept. Approaching it from different mindsets and languages.

This is the part of the synopsis where I lower your expectations:

- This talk will *not* teach you how to use Monads. But it _might_ give you a tiny bit more insight, no promises!
- This talk will use a mixture of languages and syntax but most of the examples won't compile

This talk is aimed at *Beginners*, *Advanced FP Folk* and anyone who's wondering *What's the hype with this Monad thing?*
