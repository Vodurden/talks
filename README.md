My talks.

Warning: I use these notes to help present my talks but I often go off script, skip parts
or completely change parts on the fly so it's worth keeping that in mind when reading these
disorganized notes

The slides for these talks are also hosted through github pages here: https://vodurden.github.io/talks/
