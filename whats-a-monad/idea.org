* Talk: What's a Monad?

  - Monads are notoriously tricky to understand
  - This talk isn't going to teach you Monads!
  - But I'll try to nudge your understanding one extra step
  - The word "Monad" means a lot of different things:
    - An object with a ~flatMap~ method
    - Something I can use ~for-comprehension~ on
    - A type implementing the Monad typeclass
    - A typeclass with two functions: ~bind~ and ~pure~ following some laws
    - A burrito
    - A way of composing certain types of functions
    - An interface for defining sequential computations
    - Something for managing side effects
    - A Monoid in the category of Endofunctors
  - So what is it?
  - All of them!

Overview:

- Monads are really hard to learn
- I think that's because "Monad" means a _bunch_ of different things
- Learning "Monads" actually means learning a huge number of different concepts
